    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON. It is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and is known for its flexibility, scalability, and high performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a type of database management system that does not rely on the traditional relational database model. Instead, they use a variety of data models, such as key-value, document, column-family, and graph databases, to store and manage data. Non-relational databases are often used in scenarios where there is a need for flexible and scalable data storage, such as in web and mobile applications, IoT devices, and big data applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several scenarios where it may be preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases. One such scenario is when dealing with unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media feeds, sensor data, or logs. MongoDB's document-oriented data model makes it easier to store and query this type of data than SQL databases. Additionally, MongoDB's scalability and flexibility make it a good choice for applications that require rapid growth and frequent updates, as well as those that need to scale horizontally across multiple servers. Finally, MongoDB's native support for sharding, replication, and high availability makes it a reliable choice for mission-critical applications that require 24/7 uptime.\n"
